Hi there!

My name is Ariah Mackie. 

I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Biomolecular Engineering and a Minor in Bioinformatics. Through my experience in several academic laboratories, I've learned that I'm more of a coding girl than a pipetting girl. In 2021, I shifted my career path to software engineering while I was finishing my Masters Thesis in biology at Cal Poly Humboldt. So, as I've been working to finish that Masters, I've also been following a curriculum to buff up my knowledge of software design and computer science with a large project, multiple books, and a touch of MOOC.
